/*
Linked List

1. Node Structure:
   - Define a structure/class `Node` to represent each element in the linked list.
   - Each `Node` should have a data field and a pointer to the next `Node`.

2. Linked List Class:
   - Create a class `LinkedList` to manage the linked list operations.
   - The class should have pointers to the head and tail of the list.

3. Operations:
   - Insertion:
     - Implement functions to insert elements at the beginning, end, or at a specific position in the list.
   - Deletion:
     - Provide methods to delete elements from the list, such as deleting by value or by position.
   - Traversal:
     - Write a function to traverse the list and print/display its elements.
   - Search:
     - Implement a function to search for a specific element in the list.
   - Size:
     - Create a method to return the size (number of elements) of the list.

4. Memory Management:
   - Properly manage memory allocation and deallocation, especially when inserting or deleting nodes.
   - Avoid memory leaks by deallocating memory for nodes when they are removed.
